# YoutubePlaylistManager

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.5.

## Youtube api

The following is the sample api hit to retrieve playlists by id and with an id:  https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems?part=snippet&maxResults=50&playlistId=PL871AC1BC1E1534ED&key=AIzaSyBvimgzW-ZJpVsZrFhUf2Iz479PgRcM2uw

Note that to add these videos to a playlist will most likely require an oauth request.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

## Build
